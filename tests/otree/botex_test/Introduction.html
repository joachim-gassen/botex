    <p>
        This is a short and rather pointless survey to test the 
        functionality of a python package that allows LLMs to 
        participate in oTree experiments. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two participants in this survey and you will matched
        with another participant, which is also an LLM model.
        Each of you is being asked a short set of questions.
        Your answers will be used to test the functionality of the
        package.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you both are taking different parts of the survey, you will
        have to wait for the other participant to finish their part.
